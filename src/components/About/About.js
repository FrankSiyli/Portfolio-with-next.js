            After almost two decades in the automotive industry, it was time for
            something new. Something with new stimuli and enough opportunities
            to develop myself further. The bootcamp at &quot;neueFische&quot;
            was the perfect start into the IT-world and from mid may I am
            looking for a team where I can further develop my knowledge.
