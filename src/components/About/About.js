            After nearly two decades working in the automotive industry, I
            decided it was time for a change. I wanted to explore my passion for
            technology and expand my skillset. That&apos;s why I enrolled in the
            Web Dev bootcamp at &quot;neueFische&quot;. The experience was
            nothing short of transformative and gave me the perfect start into
            the world of IT. Starting from mid-May 2023, I am excited to join a
            team where I can continue to grow and contribute to something new.
            As a skilled craftsman, I pride myself on my hands-on approach to
            problem-solving and am committed to delivering high-quality results.
            I am eager to learn from others and bring my unique perspective to
            any project.
